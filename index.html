    <p style="text-align: center;">
        So, you think it will be completely and totally fine to loan your 
        spare hard drive to your brother. After all, he's an adult at this point
        even if you still see him as your little brother. He has been navigating 
        technology for almost a decade now since he got his first computer - a little
        laptop the two of you shared - and now he's better with hardware than you are.
        He starts college this year, and he wants to borrow your remote hard drive because he 
        thinks its the easiest way to move data from his old PC at home to the new one he's 
        building at school. He's right, his terabyte of data will fit on it easily but is 
        hard to move otherwise. <br>
        If you think he's right and you should loan him the drive, congrats, you're right 
        where I was a month ago! <br>

        You poor, poor thing. <br>
        Do <strong>NOT</strong> loan your brother that hard drive. <br>
        You don't know what he's going to put on it. Not because he's malicious 
        or means you harm. No, you have no idea what is about to unfold if you loan your
        brother that hard drive. You are about to learn that no matter how smart he is about 
        hardware, he is <i>stupid</i> about software and where he downloads things from. <br>
        So no, don't sit down and run the expected mental calculus. <br>
        <br>
        No wait, what are you doing? <br>
        I said <strong>don't</strong> run the mental calculus! <br>

        Okay. Are you happy now? <br>
        You still want to loan him the hard drive? <br>
        <br>
        <strong><i>Why?</i></strong> <br>
        <br>
        Becuase you were really convinced by the what could go wrong point? <br>
        Alright. Fine then. You fool. <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <b>What Could go wrong:</b>
    </p>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
        <li>It could take him way longer than three weeks to return the drive</li>
        <li>It could take him so long he has to ship it to you</li>
        <li>You have to start the semester without it</li>
        <li>The box with it arrives in the middle of the semester</li>
        <li>You plug it into your computer while working on Web Dev Homework</li>
        <li>There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware">ransomware</a> on the hard drive now!</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        See! Look at all the things that could go very very wrong. I would know. See,
        it all happened to me! That's why this is my <a href="#second-subtitle">second website</a> 
        instead of my first. The ransomware activated in the middle of the my 
        homework for web programming, when I pushed an final update to github. As it tore 
        through my laptop's files, it broke the push to github. As such, the entire index file for 
        original first website was deleted from my laptop and the index file in the github was entirely
        blank! <br>

    </p>
    <p>
        So yes, throw out the <a href="#mental calculus">mental calculus</a> you did. 
        You brother will understand he can get himself his own hardrive - its probably for his best.
        <br>
        Protect your sanity, your essay, and your website.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Don't loan him that hard drive!</i>
        <br>
        sincerly, your past self.
