I am pushing a final update From My Doctor's meeting where I have been informed the my end of semester stress is literally causing my heart to stop working properly. I am trying to pretend to be normal about that.

Thank you for all your understanding over this semester and sorry that I have not lived up to my potential or your expectations, I feel I actually have learned a lot but not been able to demonstrate that in my assignment work and that sucks more than I can say.

I hope that with this incomplete project i was able to at least demonstrate my understanding of the concepts from this class, even if the general. falling down the stairs here's another problem state of my life has led to me being unable to properly finish it.
