I am pushing a final update From My Doctor's meeting where I have been informed the my end of semester stress is literally causing my heart to stop working properly. I am trying to pretend to be normal about that.

Thank you for all your understanding over this semester and sorry that I have not lived up to my potential or your expectations, I feel I actually have learned a lot but not been able to demonstrate that in my assignment work and that sucks more than I can say.
